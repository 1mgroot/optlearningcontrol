## This repository provides material for the class, including python scripts illustrating topics covered in the class

## working with python
### Basic installation

We will work with Python 2.7 - numpy, scipy and matlplotlib are recommended libraries to install (come with Anaconda by default)

Anaconda is a straightforward, multi-platform, easy-to-use python distribution. It can be downloaded here https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and extensive documentation is available here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/

Jupyter (comes with default Anaconda installation) is a great way to create notebooks for python. A simple tutorial can be found here https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
